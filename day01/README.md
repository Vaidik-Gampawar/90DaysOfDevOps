ðŸš€ Day 1 - #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge



Welcome to my #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge journey !

Today marks the beginning of my dive into the world of DevOps, where Iâ€™ll be learning, practicing, and sharing my progress daily.



1\. Start with the DevOps Roadmap



Watched the Introductory DevOps Roadmap video to get a high-level understanding of what DevOps is all about.



This gave me clarity on how the journey will progress and what tools, practices, and skills Iâ€™ll explore in the coming days.



2\. Created a LinkedIn Post / Small Article



I wrote about my understanding of DevOps based on todayâ€™s learning:



What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of Development and Operations, focused on bridging the gap between software development and IT operations. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery to ship reliable software faster.



What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?



Automation: Reducing manual effort by using tools and scripts to make processes like testing, deployment, and monitoring seamless.



Scaling: Ensuring systems can handle growth in users or workload without breaking.



Infrastructure: The backbone (servers, networks, cloud resources, etc.) that supports application deployment and operation.



Why is DevOps Important?

DevOps improves speed, collaboration, and reliability. It helps deliver software quickly, reduces downtime, improves product quality, and creates a feedback-driven culture for continuous improvement.



ðŸ“… Day 1 completed successfully!

Excited for the upcoming days and the knowledge Iâ€™ll gain throughout this challenge.
